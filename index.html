        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Carli!</h1>
				<p>I decided upon a career in brain sciences during middle school, while reading a novel about a girl with a rare neurological condition. Years later, inspired by a fictional story about a girl who wanted answers about her life, I aspire to answer real questions for real individuals about the brain and behavior.</p>
				<p>Currently, I'm a graduate student in Cognitive Psychology working with <a href="https://www.jaredmedina.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Jared Medina</a> at the University of Delaware. We're working on projects related to multisensory perception, illusory qualia, and cognitive neuropsychology using techniques including the Mirror Box Illusion.</p>
				<p>Before starting graduate school, I worked as a lab manager with <a href="https://www.davidbrang.com/" target="_blank">Dr. David Brang</a> at the University of Michigan where we studied multisensory perception, integration illusions, and synesthesia using cognitive neuroscience techniques including electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings.</p>
